#30 Day Challenge
Day 1 Recap: Building a Cloud-Based SOC Architecture
- Vultr CLoud Platform: The foundation of my SOC environment, providing the cloud infrastructure to securely host and manage the operations.
- Elastic & Kabana: Deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Vultr, these tools form the core of log management and visualization. 
  Analysts can interact with logs, create dashboards, and monitor activities through Kibanaâ€™s web GUI.
- Fleet Server: Managing log collection agents across different servers (Windows and Ubuntu) within the VPC
  ensuring all relevant data is captured and forwarded to Elastic & Kibana for analysis.
- Ticket Server: A dedicated server to handle alerts and incidents, automating the process of generating tickets based on log analysis.
- Secure & Isolated Network: The entire setup is hosted within a private VPC, ensuring a secure and isolated environment for sensitive log data.

Day 2 Recap: Gaining a Deeper Understanding of ELK Stack
- Elasticsearch:  A robust search and analytics engine for storing and querying logs (e.g., Windows event logs, firewall data). It supports ESQL (Elasticsearch Query Language)
  and integrates seamlessly using RESTful APIs and JSON. Kibana enables easy visualization and analysis of this data.
- Logstash: Collects and processes data using Beats or Elastic Agent:
- Beats: Lightweight data shippers designed for different data types:
- Filebeat: Log data
- Metricbeat: System and service metrics
- Winlogbeat: Windows event logs
- Packetbeat: Network traffic
- Auditbeat: Audit data
- Heartbeat: Service uptime
- Elastic Agent: A unified agent for logs, metrics, security data, and threat prevention. It can be deployed in:
- Managed by Fleet: Centralized management via Fleet in Kibana, ideal for most users.
- Standalone Mode: Manual policy application via YAML, suited for advanced configurations.
- Logstash: filters logs to focus on critical data, reducing storage costs. For instance, it can capture Windows event ID 4624 (successful logins) and send it to Elasticsearch.
- Kibana: Provides tools for visualizing data, such as Kibana Lens for dashboards, Discover for querying, and Machine Learning for anomaly detection.
