Packet Tracer Project: Configuring Wireless Router Hardening and Security
In this comprehensive Packet Tracer project, I successfully configured wireless security for a home wireless router, addressing initial security issues and hardening the router to mitigate potential attacks.
The project involved a multi-step approach to enhance the router's security, ensure secure network connections, and verify the configurations and connectivity.

Project Objective:
Part 1: Configure Basic Security Settings for a Wireless Router
- Changed the default router password to a strong passphrase.
- Disabled remote management to prevent unauthorized remote access.
  
Part 2: Configure Wireless Router Network Security
- Configured and broadcasted the SSID for the HomeNet wireless network.
- Enabled WPA2 Personal encryption with AES for secure communication.
- Set up a separate GuestNet with independent security settings to isolate guest traffic.
  
Part 3: Configure Wireless Clients Network Security
- Connected laptops and IoT devices to the secured HomeNet and GuestNet networks.
- Ensured all devices received appropriate IP addressing from the router.

Part 4: Verify Connectivity and Security Settings
- Tested internet connectivity for wireless laptops.
- Configured security settings to prevent interconnectivity between HomeNet and GuestNet, ensuring isolated network segments.
  
Key Achievements:
- Successfully hardened the wireless router against potential attacks.
- Ensured secure and encrypted communication between wireless clients and the router.
- Verified network connectivity and isolated guest network traffic to enhance overall security.
Outcome:
This project not only strengthened my understanding of wireless network security but also provided practical experience in configuring and managing secure home networks.
By implementing these security measures, I ensured a secure wireless environment, demonstrating my ability to protect against common network threats.
